    Description: `**Coming Soon** You and your friends decide to go camping before the weather turns snowy. It's exactly the kind of relaxing trip you need to unwind. But as you and your friends settle into your campsite, something seems off. It's not long before your friends start to go missing, and suddenly the legend of the killer Otter in the woods doesn't seem so far fetched. The moon is full and you'll need your investigative skills to live to see another sunrise!`,
